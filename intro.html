            <h1>The ZX-calculus - A Slightly Longer Introduction</h1>
        </div>

        <div class="row cell title">
            <h2>Reading the rules</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="square cell">
            <p>
                The ZX-calculus has two important meta-rules:
                <ul>
                    <li> Only connectivity matters </li>
                    <li> Everything is still true if you swap red and green</li>
                </ul>

                Let's give an example.
                The rule to the right is called the green spider rule,
                and this is because these coloured nodes
                remind people of spiders with bodies (the coloured circle) and legs (the black wires.)
            </p>
            <p>
                The rule is simple: If two spiders of the same colour are joined (there is a wire from one to
                the other)
                then you can merge those two spiders together.
                As you do so the newly merged spider maintains all its other connections.
                If the spiders had angles on them (called phases) then you add those angles together,
                remembering to work modulo $2 \pi$.
            </p>

            <p>
                Wires that don't have a node at both ends are called "open wires."
                These indicate that we don't mind what those wires are attached to at the other end.
                Think of them as boundaries that allow us to embed our small diagram into some larger context.
                The "..." indicates that we also don't mind how many of there wires there are (including possibly 0
                wires.)
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="square cell img" style="text-align: center;">
            <img src="./figures/sp1.svg" />
            <p class="subtle">
                The green spider rule, although the form we use here is slightly simpler than the one most commonly
                used.
            </p>

        </div>

        <div class="square cell img" style="text-align: center;">
            <img src="./figures/sp1r.svg" />
            <p class="subtle">
                The analogous red spider rule, found by just swapping the colours red and green everywhere.
            </p>

        </div>
        <div class="square cell">

            <p>
                Since everything remains true if you swap red and green (you need to swap it everywhere!)
                then this rule, called the red spider rule, also holds true.
                It says precisely the same thing, but for red spiders.
            </p>

            <p>
                The wires joining the spiders can be as long as you like,
                can bend around, leave the node in any direction, and are allowed to cross other wires freely.
                As the first meta-rule says: All that matters is the connectivity ("how many wires are there")
                between the nodes.
            </p>

            <p>
                It's important to remember that these rules are equalities:
                Whenever you see part of a diagram that looks like the left hand side of a rule you
                can replace it with the right hand side of the rule,
                but also whenever you see an instance of the right hand side of a rule you can replace it
                with the left hand side of the rule too.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="square cell">
            <p>
                Here is a rule involving
                a green $\alpha$ spider and a red $\pi$ spider,
                running along a single wire.
                The rule says that we can swap the order of these two spiders,
                but it has the side affect of flipping the sign in front of the $\alpha$.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="square cell img" style="text-align: center;">
            <img src="./figures/pi.svg" />
            <p class="subtle">
                The pi-commutation rule we show here is actually only true up to a complex scalar factor.
                This is something that can be easily fixed by just including the scalar,
                but many people prefer to work without scalars (partly because it makes it easier to see what is going
                on.)
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="square cell img" style="text-align: center;">
            <img src="./figures/H.svg" />
            <p class="subtle">
                The Hadamard rule allows you to convert red spiders to green spiders and back again.
                There need to be Hadamard gates (yellow squares) on all of the wires in the left hand diagram.
            </p>

        </div>
        <div class="square cell">
            <p>
                This is called the Hadamard rule, and it describes the action of the Hadamard gate (the yellow squares.)
                It says that we can use Hadamard gates to turn a red spider into a green spider
                (and, because of the second meta-rule, green spiders into red spiders.)
                It can be shown that two Hadamard gates applied in succession cancel each other out,
                meaning that not only is this a very versatile rule,
                but there is also a limit to how many Hadamard gates you will need in your diagram.
            </p>
            <p>
                Why is it a Hadamard gate, not a Hadamard spider?
                The Hadamard (in ZX) is limited to having two wires and two wires only.
                One can actually build it from red and green spiders,
                and so it's really just a short-hand symbol, but it's such a useful one that
                it is sometimes given the same level of status as the red and green spiders.

                These aren't all of the rules of the ZX-calculus, but they should give you enough indication of of how
                to read the rules.
                In 2018 the ZX-calculus was shown to be complete:
                This means that if you have two diagrams that describe the same matrix,
                then the rules of the ZX-calculus can take you from one to the other.

            <p>
                It is well known that one can build all quantum circuits from
                single qubit Z and X rotations, and two qubit CNOT gates.
                Quantum circuit diagrams are very rigid in structure:
                There are a fixed number of wires,
                and a fixed direction of flow in the diagram.
            </p>
            <p>
                To turn a quantum circuit diagram into a ZX-calculus diagram
                is extremely easy:
                <ul>
                    <li>Keep wires as they are</li>
                    <li>All Z rotation gates become green spiders</li>
                    <li>All X rotation gates become red spiders</li>
                    <li>All CNOT gates become a (connected) pair of red and green spiders,
                        with the green spider on the control qubit.</li>

                <p>
                    There are ZX diagrams that do not correspond to any unitary circuit
                    (this isn't a problem, it just means ZX can describe non-unitary matrices.)
                    As such there is no general method to turn a ZX diagram into a circuit diagram,
                    although a lot of work has gone into working out how to do so when you can.
                    What we <emph>can</emph> always do is turn a ZX diagram into a corresponding complex matrix.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To do this we only need to know what to do with green nodes, bent wires, and Hadamard gates
                    (and how to glue these elements together.)
                    This is because we can turn any red nodes into green nodes using the Hadamard rule described earlier.
                    We also need to pick a direction of flow in our diagram.
                    We'll be using left-to-right here, but any other orientation is possible (and needs to be clearly
                    stated.)

            <p>
                ZX-calculus diagrams are read the same way that circuit diagrams are read:
                If your circuit is running left-to-right then you break the diagram
                down into columns. You view everything happening in a column as happening at the same time,
                and take the tensor product of all the elements in that column.
                Then you view the sequence of columns as a sequence of operations,
                taking the matrix composition of those operations.
            </p>
            <p>

            <p>
                ZX-calculus have another thing that circuit diagrams do not:
                Bent wires.
                The interpretation of a bare wire running with the flow of your diagram is just the identity matrix.
                How about when a wire that forms a "cup"?
                The interpretation is given above,
                but we leave out what to do when the wire forms a "cap".
                This is because reflecting a diagram (in the vertical axis) has the effect of applying a transpose to
                the matrix interpretation.
