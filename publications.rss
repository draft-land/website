This formalism has two main advantages. First, all the operations of the phases are algebraic ones without trigonometry functions involved, thus paved the way for generalising complete axiomatisation of qubit ZX-calculus to qudit ZX-calculus and ZX-calculus over commutative semirings. Second, we characterise elementary transformations in terms of ZX diagrams, so a lot of linear algebra stuff can be done purely diagrammatically.</description><author>Quanlong Wang</author><pubDate>Sun, 26 Jul 2020 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.13739</guid></item><item><title>A Generic Compilation Strategy for the Unitary Coupled Cluster Ansatz</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.10515</link><description>We describe a compilation strategy for Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) algorithms which use the Unitary Coupled Cluster (UCC) ansatz, designed to reduce circuit depth and gate count. This is achieved by partitioning Pauli exponential terms into mutually commuting sets. These sets are then diagonalised using Clifford circuits and synthesised using the phase polynomial formalism. This strategy reduces cx depth by 75.4% on average, and by up to 89.9%, compared to naive synthesis for a variety of molecules, qubit encodings and basis sets.</description><author>Alexander Cowtan, Will Simmons and Ross Duncan</author><pubDate>Mon, 20 Jul 2020 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.10515</guid></item><item><title>Parts of Speech Tagging in NLP: Runtime Optimization with Quantum Formulation and ZX Calculus</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.10328</link><description>This paper proposes an optimized formulation of the parts of speech tagging in Natural Language Processing with a quantum computing approach and further demonstrates the quantum gate-level runnable optimization with ZX-calculus, keeping the implementation target in the context of Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum Systems (NISQ). Our quantum formulation exhibits quadratic speed up over the classical counterpart and further demonstrates the implementable optimization with the help of ZX calculus postulates.</description><author>Arit Kumar Bishwas, Ashish Mani and Vasile Palade</author><pubDate>Sun, 19 Jul 2020 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.10328</guid></item><item><title>Colored props for large scale graphical reasoning</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.03564</link><description>The prop formalism allows representation of processes withstring diagrams and has been successfully applied in various areas such as quantum computing, electric circuits and control flow graphs. However, these graphical approaches suffer from scalability problems when it comes to writing large diagrams. A proposal to tackle this issue has been investigated for ZX-calculus using colored props. This paper extends the approach to any prop, making it a general tool for graphical languages manipulation.</description><author>Titouan Carette and Simon Perdrix</author><pubDate>Tue, 07 Jul 2020 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.03564</guid></item><item><title>Well-tempered ZX and ZH calculi</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.02557</link><description>The ZX calculus is a mathematical tool to represent and analyse quantum operations by manipulating diagrams which in effect represent tensor networks. Two families of nodes of these networks are ones which commute with either Z rotations or X rotations, usually called "green nodes" and "red nodes" respectively. The original formulation of the ZX calculus was motivated in part by properties of the algebras formed by the green and red nodes: notably, that they form a bialgebra -- but only up to scalar factors. As a consequence, the diagram transformations and notation for certain unitary operations involve "scalar gadgets" which denote contributions to a normalising factor. We present renormalised generators for the ZX calculus, which form a bialgebra precisely. As a result, no scalar gadgets are required to represent the most common unitary transformations, and the corresponding diagram transformations are generally simpler. We also present a similar renormalised version of the ZH calculus. We obtain these results by an analysis of conditions under which various "idealised" rewrites are sound, leveraging the existing presentations of the ZX and ZH calculi.</description><author>Niel de Beaudrap</author><pubDate>Wed, 03 Jun 2020 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.02557</guid></item><item><title>The ZX&amp; calculus: A complete graphical calculus for classical circuits using spiders</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.05287</link><description>We give a complete presentation for the fragment, ZX&amp;, of the ZX-calculus generated by the Z and X spiders (corresponding to copying and addition) along with the not gate and the and gate. To prove completeness, we freely add units and counits to the category TOF generated by the Toffoli gate and ancillary bits, showing that this yields the strictification of spans of powers of the two element set; and then perform a two way translation between this category and ZX&amp;. A translation to some extension of TOF, as opposed to some fragment of the ZX-calculus, is a natural choice because of the multiplicative nature of the Toffoli gate. To this end, we show that freely adding counits to the semi-Frobenius algebra of a discrete inverse category is the same as computing the "environment structure" of the classical structures of the base discrete inverse category. We show that in this setting, the classical channels and the discrete Cartesian completion are the same constructions. Therefore, in the case of TOF, freely adding a counit, constructing the category of quantum channels, and computing the discrete Cartesian completion are all equivalent to partial functions between powers of the two element set. By glueing together the free counit completion and the free unit completion, this yields the strictification of spans between powers of the two element set. </description><author>Cole Comfort</author><pubDate>Wed, 29 Apr 2020 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.05287</guid></item><item><title>Fast and effective techniques for T-count reduction via spider nest identities</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.05164</link><description>In fault-tolerant quantum computing systems, realising (approximately) universal quantum computation is usually described in terms of realising Clifford+T operations, which is to say a circuit of CNOT, Hadamard, and π/2-phase rotations, together with T operations (π/4-phase rotations). For many error correcting codes, fault-tolerant realisations of Clifford operations are significantly less resource-intensive than those of T gates, which motivates finding ways to realise the same transformation involving T-count (the number of T gates involved) which is as low as possible. Investigations into this problem [arXiv:1206.0758, 1303.2042, 1308.4134, 1601.07363, 1606.01904, 1701.00140] has led to observations that this problem is closely related to NP-hard tensor decomposition problems [arXiv:1712.01557] and is tantamount to the difficult problem of decoding exponentially long Reed-Muller codes [arXiv:1601.07363]. This problem then presents itself as one for which must be content in practise with approximate optimisation, in which one develops an array of tactics to be deployed through some pragmatic strategy. In this vein, we describe techniques to reduce the T-count, based on the effective application of "spider nest identities": easily recognised products of parity-phase operations which are equivalent to the identity operation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of such techniques by obtaining improvements in the T-counts of a number of circuits, in run-times which are typically less than the time required to make a fresh cup of coffee. </description><author>Niel de Beaudrap, Xiaoning Bian and Quanlong Wang</author><pubDate>Fri, 10 Apr 2020 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.05164</guid></item><item><title>Hypergraph simplification: Linking the path-sum approach to the ZH-calculus</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.13564</link><description>The ZH-calculus is a complete graphical calculus for linear maps between qubits that admits, for example, a straightforward encoding of hypergraph states and circuits arising from the Toffoli+Hadamard gate set. In this paper, we establish a correspondence between the ZH-calculus and the path-sum formalism, a technique recently introduced by Amy to verify quantum circuits. In particular, we find a bijection between certain canonical forms of ZH-diagrams and path-sum expressions. We then introduce and prove several new simplification rules for the ZH-calculus, which are in direct correspondence to the simplification rules of the path-sum formalism. The relatively opaque path-sum rules are shown to arise naturally as the convergence of two consequences of the ZH-calculus. The first is the extension of the familiar graph-theoretic simplifications based on local complementation and pivoting to their hypergraph-theoretic analogues: hyper-local complementation and hyper-pivoting. The second is the graphical Fourier transform introduced by Kuijpers et al., which enables effective simplification of ZH-diagrams encoding multi-linear phase polynomials with arbitrary real coefficients.</description><author>Louis Lemonnier, John van de Wetering and Aleks Kissinger</author><pubDate>Mon, 30 Mar 2020 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.13564</guid></item><item><title>Entanglement and Quaternions: The graphical calculus ZQ</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.09999</link><description>Graphical calculi are vital tools for representing and reasoning about quantum circuits and processes. Some are not only graphically intuitive but also logically complete. The best known of these is the ZX-calculus, which is an industry candidate for an Intermediate Representation; a language that sits between the algorithm designer's intent and the quantum hardware's gate instructions. The ZX calculus, built from generalised Z and X rotations, has difficulty reasoning about arbitrary rotations. This contrasts with the cross-hardware compiler TriQ which uses these arbitrary rotations to exploit hardware efficiencies. In this paper we introduce the graphical calculus ZQ, which uses quaternions to represent these arbitrary rotations, similar to TriQ, and the phase-free Z spider to represent entanglement, similar to ZX. We show that this calculus is sound and complete for qubit quantum computing, while also showing that a fully spider-based representation would have been impossible. This new calculus extends the zoo of qubit graphical calculi, each with different strengths, and we hope it will provide a common language for the optimisation procedures of both ZX and TriQ.</description><author>Hector Miller-Bakewell</author><pubDate>Sun, 22 Mar 2020 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.09999</guid></item><item><title>The Structure of Sum-Over-Paths, its Consequences, and Completeness for Clifford</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.05678</link><description>We show that the formalism of "Sum-Over-Path" (SOP), used for symbolically representing linear maps or quantum operators, together with a proper rewrite system, has a structure of dagger-compact PROP. Several consequences arise from this observation: 1) Morphisms of SOP are very close to the diagrams of the graphical calculus called ZH-Calculus, so we give a system of interpretation between the two; 2) A construction, called the discard construction, can be applied to enrich the formalism so that, in particular, it can represent the quantum measurement. We also enrich the rewrite system so as to get the completeness of the Clifford fragments of both the initial formalism and its enriched version.</description><author>Renaud Vilmart</author><pubDate>Thu, 12 Mar 2020 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.05678</guid></item></channel></rss>
