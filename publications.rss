These diagrams represent the underlying mathematical operations and aid physical interpretation, but cannot generally be computed with directly. In this paper we introduce the ZXH-calculus, a graphical language based on the ZX-calculus, that we use to represent and reason about many-body states entirely graphically. As a demonstration, we express the 1D AKLT state, a symmetry protected topological state, in the ZXH-calculus by developing a representation of spins higher than 1/2 within the calculus. By exploiting the simplifying power of the ZXH-calculus rules we show how this representation straightforwardly recovers two important properties, the existence of topologically protected edge states, and the non-vanishing of a string order parameter. We furthermore show how the AKLT matrix-product state representation can be recovered from our diagrams. In addition, we provide an alternative proof that the 2D AKLT state on a hexagonal lattice can be reduced to a graph state, demonstrating that it is a universal quantum computing resource. Our results show that the ZXH-calculus is a powerful language for representing and computing with physical states entirely graphically, paving the way to develop more efficient many-body algorithms.</description><author>Richard D.

This work continues the exploration of graphical calculi, inside and outside of the quantum computing setting, by investigating the algebraic structures with which we label diagrams. The initial aim for this was Conjecture Synthesis; the algorithmic process of creating theorems. To this process we introduce a generalisation step, which itself requires the ability to infer and then verify parameterised families of theorems. This thesis introduces such inference and verification frameworks, in doing so forging novel links between graphical calculi and fields such as Algebraic Geometry and Galois Theory. These frameworks inspired further research into the design of graphical calculi, and we introduce two important new calculi here. First is the calculus RING, which is initial among ring-based qubit graphical calculi, and in turn inspired the introduction and classification of phase homomorphism pairs also presented here. The second is the calculus ZQ, an edge-decorated calculus which naturally expresses arbitrary qubit rotations, eliminating the need for non-linear rules such as (EU) of ZX. It is expected that these results will be of use to those creating optimisation schemes and intermediate representations for quantum computing, to those creating new graphical calculi, and for those performing conjecture synthesis.</description><author>Hector Miller-Bakewell</author><pubDate>Thu, 08 Oct 2020 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.03914</guid></item><item><title>A Recipe for Quantum Graphical Languages</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.4230/LIPIcs.ICALP.2020.118</link><description>Different graphical calculi have been proposed to represent quantum computation. First the ZX- calculus [4], followed by the ZW-calculus [12] and then the ZH-calculus [1]. We can wonder if new Z*-calculi will continue to be proposed forever. This article answers negatively. All those language share a common core structure we call Z*-algebras. We classify Z*-algebras up to isomorphism in two dimensional Hilbert spaces and show that they are all variations of the aforementioned calculi. We do the same for linear relations and show that the calculus of [2] is essentially the unique one.</description><author>Titouan Carette and Emmanuel Jeandel</author><pubDate>Mon, 10 Aug 2020 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.04193</guid></item><item><title>Algebraic complete axiomatisation of ZX-calculus with a normal form via elementary matrix operations</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.13739</link><description>In this paper we give a complete axiomatisation of qubit ZX-calculus via elementary transformations which are basic operations in linear algebra. This formalism has two main advantages. First, all the operations of the phases are algebraic ones without trigonometry functions involved, thus paved the way for generalising complete axiomatisation of qubit ZX-calculus to qudit ZX-calculus and ZX-calculus over commutative semirings. Second, we characterise elementary transformations in terms of ZX diagrams, so a lot of linear algebra stuff can be done purely diagrammatically.</description><author>Quanlong Wang</author><pubDate>Sun, 26 Jul 2020 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.13739</guid></item><item><title>A Generic Compilation Strategy for the Unitary Coupled Cluster Ansatz</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.10515</link><description>We describe a compilation strategy for Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) algorithms which use the Unitary Coupled Cluster (UCC) ansatz, designed to reduce circuit depth and gate count. This is achieved by partitioning Pauli exponential terms into mutually commuting sets. These sets are then diagonalised using Clifford circuits and synthesised using the phase polynomial formalism. This strategy reduces cx depth by 75.4% on average, and by up to 89.9%, compared to naive synthesis for a variety of molecules, qubit encodings and basis sets.</description><author>Alexander Cowtan, Will Simmons and Ross Duncan</author><pubDate>Mon, 20 Jul 2020 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.10515</guid></item><item><title>Parts of Speech Tagging in NLP: Runtime Optimization with Quantum Formulation and ZX Calculus</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.10328</link><description>This paper proposes an optimized formulation of the parts of speech tagging in Natural Language Processing with a quantum computing approach and further demonstrates the quantum gate-level runnable optimization with ZX-calculus, keeping the implementation target in the context of Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum Systems (NISQ).

However, these graphical approaches suffer from scalability problems when it comes to writing large diagrams. A proposal to tackle this issue has been investigated for ZX-calculus using colored props. This paper extends the approach to any prop, making it a general tool for graphical languages manipulation.</description><author>Titouan Carette and Simon Perdrix</author><pubDate>Tue, 07 Jul 2020 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.03564</guid></item><item><title>Well-tempered ZX and ZH calculi</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.02557</link><description>The ZX calculus is a mathematical tool to represent and analyse quantum operations by manipulating diagrams which in effect represent tensor networks. Two families of nodes of these networks are ones which commute with either Z rotations or X rotations, usually called "green nodes" and "red nodes" respectively. The original formulation of the ZX calculus was motivated in part by properties of the algebras formed by the green and red nodes: notably, that they form a bialgebra -- but only up to scalar factors. As a consequence, the diagram transformations and notation for certain unitary operations involve "scalar gadgets" which denote contributions to a normalising factor. We present renormalised generators for the ZX calculus, which form a bialgebra precisely. As a result, no scalar gadgets are required to represent the most common unitary transformations, and the corresponding diagram transformations are generally simpler. We also present a similar renormalised version of the ZH calculus. We obtain these results by an analysis of conditions under which various "idealised" rewrites are sound, leveraging the existing presentations of the ZX and ZH calculi.</description><author>Niel de Beaudrap</author><pubDate>Wed, 03 Jun 2020 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.02557</guid></item><item><title>The ZX&amp; calculus: A complete graphical calculus for classical circuits using spiders</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.05287</link><description>We give a complete presentation for the fragment, ZX&amp;, of the ZX-calculus generated by the Z and X spiders (corresponding to copying and addition) along with the not gate and the and gate. To prove completeness, we freely add units and counits to the category TOF generated by the Toffoli gate and ancillary bits, showing that this yields the strictification of spans of powers of the two element set; and then perform a two way translation between this category and ZX&amp;. A translation to some extension of TOF, as opposed to some fragment of the ZX-calculus, is a natural choice because of the multiplicative nature of the Toffoli gate. To this end, we show that freely adding counits to the semi-Frobenius algebra of a discrete inverse category is the same as computing the "environment structure" of the classical structures of the base discrete inverse category. We show that in this setting, the classical channels and the discrete Cartesian completion are the same constructions. Therefore, in the case of TOF, freely adding a counit, constructing the category of quantum channels, and computing the discrete Cartesian completion are all equivalent to partial functions between powers of the two element set. By glueing together the free counit completion and the free unit completion, this yields the strictification of spans between powers of the two element set. </description><author>Cole Comfort</author><pubDate>Wed, 29 Apr 2020 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.05287</guid></item><item><title>Tensor Network Rewriting Strategies for Satisfiability and Counting</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.06455</link><description>We provide a graphical treatment of SAT and #SAT on equal footing. Instances of #SAT can be represented as tensor networks in a standard way. These tensor networks are interpreted by diagrams of the ZH-calculus: a system to reason about tensors over $ℂ$ in terms of diagrams built from simple generators, in which computation may be carried out by \emphtransformations of diagrams alone. In general, nodes of ZH diagrams take parameters over $ℂ$ which determine the tensor coefficients; for the standard representation of #SAT instances, the coefficients take the value $0$ or $1$. Then, by choosing the coefficients of a diagram to range over $\mathbb B$, we represent the corresponding instance of SAT. Thus, by interpreting a diagram either over the boolean semiring or the complex numbers, we instantiate either the \emphdecision or \emphcounting version of the problem. We find that for classes known to be in P, such as $2$SAT and #XORSAT, the existence of appropriate rewrite rules allows for efficient simplification of the diagram, producing the solution in polynomial time. In contrast, for classes known to be NP-complete, such as $3$SAT, or #P-complete, such as #$2$SAT, the corresponding rewrite rules introduce hyperedges to the diagrams, in numbers which are not easily bounded above by a polynomial. This diagrammatic approach unifies the diagnosis of the complexity of CSPs and #CSPs and shows promise in aiding tensor network contraction-based algorithms.</description><author>Niel de Beaudrap, Aleks Kissinger and Konstantinos Meichanetzidis</author><pubDate>Tue, 14 Apr 2020 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.06455</guid></item></channel></rss>
