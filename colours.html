<h1>Suggested red and green colours</h1>

<p>
  The ZX calculus has always been a red / green calculus.
  This can cause problems if authors use shades of red and green that are hard to distinguish
  for people with CVD.
  We present here shades of red and green that should be distinguishable
  by people with any form of CVD, will print clearly in greyscale,
  and satisfies the W3 web standards for contrast against black text.

<div style="padding: 1em; background: #e8a6a6">
  This is black text against the preferred shade of red

<h2>How to implement in LaTeX</h2>

Simply add the following two snippets of code to your preamble. The first defines the colours "zx_red" and "zx_green":

<pre>
\definecolor{zx_red}{RGB}{232, 165, 165}
\definecolor{zx_green}{RGB}{216, 248, 216}
</pre>

The second defines two node types "gn" and "rn" for use inside tikz diagrams:

<pre>
\tikzstyle{gn}=[rectangle,rounded corners=0.8em,fill=zx_green,draw=Black,line width=0.8 pt,inner sep=3pt,minimum width=1.5em,minimum height=1.5em]
\tikzstyle{rn}=[rectangle,rounded corners=0.8em,fill=zx_red,draw=Black,line width=0.8 pt,inner sep=3pt,minimum width=1.5em,minimum height=1.5em]
</pre>

Note that we encourage rounded rectangles over circles.
